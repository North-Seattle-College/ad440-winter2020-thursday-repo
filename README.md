## Getting Started
This practicum is geared AWS, and uses React, Javascript, Node, and MySQL. This app does not use a traditional stack, like LAMP, or SEAN. Rather it breaks its tasks down into descrete files of code that execute using AWS services like Lambda, and S3. 

### Installing
While the app is deployed to the cloud, there are several local tools one should have local on their computer if they want to join in the development of this app. You may not need all the tools listed to work on this app.
